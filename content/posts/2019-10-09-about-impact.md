Maybe it's from working around healthcare professionals and being exposed to some tough individuel stories or maybe it's from reading [the last lecture](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Lecture-Randy-Pausch/dp/1401323251) not too long ago,  I had this thing dawn on me:

Even though we are essentially healthy people, fueled by Soylent, long distance running, yoga, meditation  and mindfulness - as a biological based organisms we are not long for this world.

And I don't mean it the morbid way, more like in a reality conscious, fact-of-life kind of way. I think Tim Urban framed it pretty well on his blog [Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/fire-light.html) (paraphrasing here): On the very basic level we are  biological containers meant to carry encoded genome information and pass it on to other containers.

So that whole bundle of bio-truth led me to think about impact. Being very [time and timing aware](https://slashproject.co/200words/2019/04/04/time-merchant.html) the question to me isn't "what legacy I am going to leave behind" because (a) that is pretty morbid and I'm not about that and (b) legacy is very subjective and it sounds like a thing other people would retrospect on rather a thing that I can influence. The question I'm asking myself is **"am I making an impact today"**.

Trying to break down what "Impact" means, I identify three levels of impact -

* Myself
* People that are close to me
* Impact at scale

Creating positive impact on myself is something that I'm constantly working towards and is reflected in my [personal mission statement](https://slashproject.co/meta/2019/03/09/mission-statement-20.html): Being mindful, empathetic and aware is constatant work and slowly becoming a framework for personal growth. It's an everyday at a time kind of business and the impact is well felt.

From there it's all about taking those core principals and put them to scale: How can I model my personal mission statement and project those values to my family, team and people around me and one level higher, how do I make sure that workplace project I'm involved at positively impact a large amount of 3rd circle people.

I'm going to focus on stuff that matters, is what I'm trying to say.
