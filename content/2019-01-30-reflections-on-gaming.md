After 4.5 years, 1,500 hours of gameplay and probably couple of hundreds of dollars in investment I uninstalled [Heores of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/).  The game I thought I'll play until Blizzard turns of its servers and invested hours in mix-maxing - uninstalled. And it feels good, really good.

It's that the game isn't good from a gameplay or  community perspective, it was just that for me it wasn't fun anymore: I wasn't having fun losing, I felt indifferent when winning and regardless of those neutral or negative feelings I kept hitting the 'Play' button to get another dose.

These days, gaming is all about relaxing and putting this break between a long day of work and the few free hours I have at the end of the day but above all it should be a fun, positive experience to close out the day and I'm really glad I was able to ask myself the 'why' and let go.

I have zero regrets on any of those 1,500 hours of HotS. I met great people through it, it inspired me to get into competitive gaming and I'm most likely be back someday but until then, I'll see you around.
