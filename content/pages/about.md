Slug: about

I'm the maker behind [project Ignite](https://projectignite.us) - a minimalist framework to star doing anything, <br/>[esports Radar](https://esportsradar.app) - a signal based esports news aggregator and this very website right here!

currently working as the consumer digital experience officer at [Dayton Children's Hospital](https://www.childrensdayton.org/) and a product person all around for the past decade.

Creating a positive impact through empathy, innovation and meaningful use of technology is [my mission statement](/posts/2019/mission-statement-20). I love exploring how technology can solve major issues we're dealing with in the fields of healthcare, consumerism and the environment.
