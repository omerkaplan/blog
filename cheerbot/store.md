## When you buy Cheerbot stuff, money goes to doing good with code

**Here's how it works:**

My goal is donate as much money as possible towards organizations dedicated to teaching code and making sure the world is a better place using technology. I also want to make additional desings and potentially cooler merch (cheerbot shirts, it'll be a thing!).

So out of $5.00 from stickers, $1 goes to processing fees ðŸ˜“ $2 goes to making additional designs and $2 goes to donation.

## Shipping worldwide

Some of the best reactions to Cheerbot are coming from friends overseas, so I'll definitely ship you a sticker if you're outside the US!
