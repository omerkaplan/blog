# I care about your information

**Here's how it works:** When you send CheerBot a direct message on Twitter, Twitter sends back a whole bunch of information back on the message sent, but also about your account (if you're into technical stuff, [read here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/get-sent-message)). Some of that information I need in order CheerBot to do it's job, like taking the message you sent and get the friend's name so CheerBot can send something positive back.

Other information (like, the internet address for your profile picture or profile background) I get but don't need. **I want you to know that I'll do anything in my power to use information given from Twitter responsively and only for the purpose you sent it to me.**
I won't read or store any data that I shouldn't need in order to operate CheerBot, I just belive your information should be respected.

If you have any question regarding CheerBot and privacy, feel free to reach out. I should have some means of communication in CheerBot's [about page](/cheerbot/about).
