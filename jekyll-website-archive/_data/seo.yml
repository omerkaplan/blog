# This data file is meant to be used for the site's SEO optimization
# I'm using a seperate data file so updaing this one is easier
# and so we don't have to touch _config.yml all that often
# note that definitions on this page are used mostly in head.html and affect both the site's
# SEO (meaning, meta keywords and stuff like that) and also social sharing cards
