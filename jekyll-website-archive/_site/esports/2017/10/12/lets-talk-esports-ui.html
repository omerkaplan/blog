    <section class="main-content">
    <p>Last weekend was full of good esports: I got to see bits and pieces of the <a href="http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/worlds">League of Legends 2017 world championship</a> that is kicking into high gear, got to see couple of matches from the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017wc">Magic: The Gathering worlds</a> and just as any other week, got to <a href="http://us.heroesofthestorm.com/esports/en/">watch HGC</a> where teams struggled to stay in the pro league. Good times.</p>

<p>All this esports, especially when all 3 event were either world championship or ramping up towards a major event got me to think about how this content is served to the viewer at home, especially the one that is exposed to the game as a casual, non hardcore gamer.</p>

<h2 id="information-overload">Information Overload</h2>

<p>League of Legends is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena">MOBA</a> I casually play to escape from the competitive environment of other games like Heroes of the Storm. League has a huge player base and is currently spearheading esports alongside other big, veteran titles like Counter Strike.</p>

<p>My in game knowledge of League is pretty superficial. As a casual player I play the champions who look cool (I’m looking at you big-shield-lady) and enjoy the rivalries and pace of the esport but other than that, I’m a newcomer. Last weekend the League game I was watching had approximately 225,000 viewers watching it, and when I tuned in this is what it looked like -</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/slashproject/img/post/esports-ui.png" alt="alt text" title="LoL esports UI" /></p>

<p>The amount of information to process as a new viewer is overwhelming to a point it’s to understand where to start reading the screen from. Here’s a quick layout of the thoughts while tuning in -</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Question</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">How do I figure it out</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Who is playing right now?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Ok, I see the logos up top</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">What’s the score in the series?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Not entirely sure, maybe it’s a best of 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">What’s the score in the match?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">9-7 is the kill count, I wonder why is that highlighted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">What champions are currently in play?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The images are super small, to this day I have no idea</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>While I can make the case for the two sidebars representing the champions, the bottom of the screen (other than the mini-map) is overloaded with information I, as a new viewer have no idea on how to interpret and in a broadcast this is served to hundreds of thousands of viewers, I wonder how many of those share the same sentiment as I did.</p>

<p>I’m not even talking about onboarding someone who is new to LoL and get him\her excited about the world championship.</p>

  <p>Wouldn’t be exponentially cooler if I could watch a LoL match full screen on my TV or laptop while checking the item list and score on a web page?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="more-action-on-screen-information-on-demand">More action on screen, information on demand</h2>

<p>What I need as a new/casual viewer is a fast way to tap into the narrative and storyline of the match that is currently happening: One way of enabling that is providing the minimal amount of information required as I’m tuning in while allowing maximum real estate for the action.</p>

<p>To compare, here is the Heroes of the Storm HGC interface</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/slashproject/img/post/esports-ui-hots.png" alt="alt text" title="Heroes of the storm esports UI" /></p>

<p>Not 100% optimal but personally I like this one better from a casual viewer perspective as it gets me straight into the action and provide all the necessary information in a “glance-able” way. I would argue that the talent icons below the hero portraits is way to small to notice and even for a veteran viewer it’s often hard to tell between the different ones, I’d keep only the heroic choice and keep the other information on demand.</p>

<p>Speaking of on demand, and it goes to all esports (that I’m aware of) it’s funny how in an age where companies can create an multi-screen, interactive exepreince, they still cram all the information on the main stream view: Both League of Legends and (soon) Heroes of the Storm support an API for in game data that can be used so stream information out of the live game.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t be exponentially cool if I could watch a LoL match full screen on my TV or laptop while checking the item list and score on a web page? Would also be more beneficial to the company broadcasting since within that web page I could get exposed to more information, related items etc.</p>

<p>An e(?)sport that’s really asking for it is Magic: The Gathering</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/slashproject/img/post/esports-ui-mtg.png" alt="alt text" title="MTG esports UI" /></p>

<p>Getting insight and statistics into decks played and look at the cards being played without being dependant on the stream showing me the latest card played could really go a long way for a viewer who is new to the game and/or doesn’t know much about the current meta-game.</p>

<h2 id="a-production-state-of-mind">A production state of mind</h2>

<p>I think that the last point was kind of crucial and is a good way to close out this post: For better or worse, esports productions are influenced still by sports productions and rightfully so; there are decades of accumulated knowledge that can contribute to esports’ accelerated growth and adoption by a wider audience.</p>

<p>What I’m hoping to see is tapping into the digital nature of video games and using technology to provide a better viewing experience  in an engaging way that will clean my screen of 1,393,833 unnecessary icons and let me see the actual match.</p>
