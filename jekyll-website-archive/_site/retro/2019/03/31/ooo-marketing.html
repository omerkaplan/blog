    <p>The family and I went on  vacation last week and just before we left I had to go through the corporate exercise of setting an automatic “Out of office” message. Now, I could go for the obvious yet effective</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll be out between <em>[start_date]</em> and <em>[end_date]</em> with limited access to email. Please call my department at <em>[phone]</em> for any inquiries. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead I went with -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi! ✨</p>

  <p>I’m out of office returning Monday, April 1 (even though it’s April fools I’ll be here, promise) and will have limited access to email.</p>

  <p>For urgent stuff, don’t hesitate to text me at xxx-xxx-xxxx or dial the marketing awesome solve-your-problems line at x1234.</p>

  <p>While you are waiting my return, feel free to get to know me better and read about -</p>

  <p><u>Why do I bring a notebook to meetings over a laptop</u></p>

  <p><u>Prioritizing user problems</u></p>

  <p><u>My personal mission statement</u></p>

  <p>Have a great week!</p>

  <p>Omer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My thought process around the more personalized, self promoting format for the out-of-office message was that I have an opportunity to deliver a message to internal members of my organization in an informal way.</p>

<p>My thought process around the more personalized, self promoting format for the out-of-office message was that I have an opportunity to deliver a message to internal members of my organization in an informal way.</p>

<p>Another benefit of those out of office messages that I didn’t think about  was how <em>deep</em> into the organization those messages actually get (!) As a member of several cross functional teams (and as a result - email listings) every time someone from a distant team looped me in on a conversation, they got the message and got exposed to the ‘get to know me better’ part.</p>

<p>The results were awesome: One of the parts that’s important for me to be successful is laying broad communication lines that also run deep and cross-pollinate. While formal meetings and work email have their merits, there is great value is exposing informal, more personal aspects of communication to build that ever so vital social capital.</p>

<p>I got plenty of great feedback on the actual content from people in teams I don’t usually reach, which in turn gives me the opportunity to form additional connections. So OOO messages as personal marketing? I say it’s a thing.</p>
