I got to play the first 10 hours of Anthem, the new co-op third person action game from Bioware and had a pretty good time: The game is gorgeous from a design perspective and even more importantly, I got to play a transformer and to fly around in this amazing world mixing a tropical landscape and future tech.

What was interesting to me after talking about the game with some friends (and consuming some videos on YouTube) I got the impression that the sentiment about the game is bad, and this is over generalizing because disappointment comes from different angles, because the game isn't fun _enough_ or it _didn't  reach it' full fun potential_ and _they'll get it right eventually_.

I wonder when did we begin min\maxing and investing in optimization of fun. I took the experience as it is and had a good time. Can it be more fun? Maybe. Can ANY experience be better and optimized? Most likely. It's just a bit of a shame that some people would dismiss a good time they had with a game, or anything really that fulfilled their initial expectations based on the fact that it could be better.

Fun is fun!
