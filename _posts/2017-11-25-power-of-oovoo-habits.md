Interestingly enough, this post was supposed to be a mash up of book reviews I finished reading recently about habit forming, among them are [Power of habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU), [Hooked](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products-ebook/dp/B00LMGLXTS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512145439&sr=1-1&keywords=hooked) and early impressions of [Contagious](https://www.amazon.com/Contagious-Things-Catch-Jonah-Berger-ebook/dp/B008J4GQKW/ref=pd_sim_351_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7FFJR246A50J5NJZDTZR) (I'm all about the habit train recently) and it just so happens that life threw an actual use case my way to make that analysis all that better.

Last week we announced the [gradual shut down of ooVoo](https://oovoo.com/blog/posts/oovoo-shutting-down), a 10 year application and the product I was actively working on for the past 6 years. Over the course of the week since the announcement I found myself mostly talking to users, listening to amazing stories and sharing some of my own. I'll tell you this though, being the "last guy who goes out the room and turns off the light" and escorting a powerhouse of a product into shutting down is a powerful experience professionally.

I'm humbled and grateful that the community I was waking up for every morning also gave me a great experience saying goodbye ðŸ§¡

## Gushing aside, let's talk habits!

Over my career at ooVoo, I've been a part of some really strong, needle moving, up-and-to-the-right releases and some not as successful. There were a lot of words written about the latest ooVoo release where the company basically pivoted and changed the focus of the app from a communication tool into a social sharing network backed up by video calls.

While early testing and focus were not perfect but not heavily alarming (at least on the user facing side of things) the community response once the upgrade went live to production was very explicit, numbers went down and reviews were one star all day every day.

I had some time to process and reflect on the latest product moves at ooVoo while reading those books I mentioned above so even though I can probably write a short book about those 6 years of product managing a video communication app targeted at young adults, here are some recent, fresh takeaways.

## Green dots matter

One of the hottest debates between design, product and engineering that would raise its head every couple of months is whether should we remove the green dot icon that indicates a person is online.

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.img_path_url}}{{site.img_path_url_post}}/oovoo-online-user.png "Green dot = online")

The argument on one side was that green dots are obsolete: In the age of push notifications, VoIP push notifications, Apple CallKit and the Android counterpart that needs better branding, there is a basis for the claim that everybody's online all the time. When you video call someone, it's on us to make sure the other person gets the call from a technical perspective and do a good work in communicating the process for the person that is making that call.

In real life, users revolted when we took out the green dot. From a technical perspective we saw the same amount of calls connect but a decrease in the number of calls actually being initiated. In addition "Seeing who's online" went to the top of our community requested features.

**Green dots used to be ooVoo's habitual cue for video communication**.

Other than giving users a sense of "hey, I'm not alone out here, some of my friends are actually online and there's an community connected to this service", the green dot was the element that kicked off the habit of starting a group call with your friends something along the lines of -

I crave human connection** â–º I see a green dot (cue) â–º I ooVoo a friend (routine) â–º I have good time talking (reward)
