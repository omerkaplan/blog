##Homepage Structure
_Last update June 27, 2017_

For convenience (and later on SEO purposes) I deconstructed the homepage so it now points to includes for each section.

All the different sections can be found in the includes directory:

* **head** - Includes the '<html>' tag as well as all the head and meta stuff the goes in there
* **title** - Includes the title header for each page as well as the '<body>' tag.
* **content layer** - Is not in the includes (yet?) and have the main content of the page (post, homepage, etc)
* **footer** - Includes the footer stuff
* **scripts** - Includes the scripts section starts with '</body> and ends with '/<html>'
